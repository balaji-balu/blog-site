## Daily Sādhanā (Spiritual Practice)

##### 1. Antarśuddhi (Inner Purity) & Sākṣī Bhāva (Witness Consciousness)

- True integrity means observing the mind without judgment. The mind is always active, but through awareness, it can be mastered.

- Observe attentively. Do not engage with thoughts—let them arise and dissolve. Instead, observe emotions. If there are no emotions, turn awareness inward to the subtle presence of the inner body (Prāṇa).

- Remain uninterested in the content of thoughts. Simply witness whatever arises with full attention, without labeling it as good or bad. This detachment is the foundation of inner stability.

### 2. Anātma Viveka (Discrimination of the Non-Self)

- Do not claim ownership over thoughts. The mind (Manas) is conditioned by Saṃskāras (past impressions) and collective memory. The true Self (Ātman) is beyond this conditioning.

- The mind becomes clear (Sattvic) when observed without attachment. Awareness alone leads to clarity, allowing for spontaneous and dharmic decision-making.

- The mind is shaped and controlled by collective memory (Karma and Vāsanās). Individual free will is an illusion; true liberation (Mokṣa) comes from transcending conditioning.

### 3. Dhyāna Krama (Stages of Inner Awareness)

- If thoughts are loud, follow this inward journey:

**Pratijñā (Acknowledgment)**: Accept—"My thoughts are loud. It is okay."

**Prāṇānusandhāna (Breath Awareness)**: Shift attention to the natural breath.

**Bhāva Anusandhāna (Emotion Awareness)**: Gently move awareness toward the feeling behind the thoughts.

**Prāṇa Śakti Jñāna (Inner Energy Awareness)**: Observe the subtle presence of the inner body.

**Śuddha Cetanā (Pure Awareness)**: Finally, expand attention to include both the inner body and awareness itself—like the merging of stillness and pure presence (Sat-Chit-Ānanda).

**Sākṣī Drishti (Witness Awareness)**: If thoughts and emotions subside, stay with the inner body and awareness. Periodically ask, "What is happening now within me?"

### 4. How to Observe the Inner Body (Prāṇa Awareness Step-by-Step)

- First, sit in stillness with eyes closed. Let the body be relaxed but alert.
- Bring your awareness to your hands. Feel the subtle energy (Prāṇa)—a tingling, warmth, or gentle vibration.
- Move the awareness to your legs, sensing the same Prāṇa there.
- Expand attention to include the arms, chest, abdomen, and back, feeling the life force (Prāṇa) within.
- Finally, bring awareness to the whole body at once, sensing the inner aliveness without any thoughts.
- As awareness deepens, merge this with the silent witnessing presence (Sākṣī Bhāva).
- If no emotions or thoughts arise, remain in this pure presence.
- Occasionally ask, "What is happening now in me?" to remain aware.

### 5. Ātma Vichāra (Self-Inquiry – Going Beyond Observation)

- Once the mind is quiet, shift from witnessing to inquiring.
- Ask "Who am I?" or "What am I?"
- Do not seek an intellectual answer. Instead, remain in the silent presence where the question dissolves.
- This inquiry leads to the recognition that you are not the body, thoughts, emotions, or mind—but the pure, unchanging awareness in which everything arises.
- This is Jñāna Yoga—the path of knowledge and liberation (Mokṣa).

By following this practice, one moves from awareness of mind and emotions → awareness of the inner body → awareness of Awareness itself → Self-inquiry and realization.
