### You cannot control the mind
Your mind is controlled by the pancha kosas (five layers of existence), which are guided by the pancha pranas (five life energies). These pranas are influenced by the collective unconscious. This means that at the level of the mind, you don’t have real free will—your thoughts and actions are mostly automatic.

Because you are so used to identifying with your mind, you suffer. You believe you are in control, but in reality, the mind works on its own. The way out of this suffering is simple: observe your mind instead of getting involved with it.

When you stop paying attention to your thoughts and shift your focus to pure awareness, you will start noticing a deeper space within you. This space is called Antaratma—your true inner self, beyond thoughts and emotions.

It can be hard to step out of the mind because of strong habits. To make it easier, use the gates to the present moment:

- Watch your breath – Feel it going in and out naturally.
- Feel your inner body – Notice the energy and aliveness inside you.
- Observe emotions – See them as movements of energy, not personal problems.

When you shift your focus from thoughts to the present moment, you automatically enter your true state—Sat-Chit-Ananda (Truth, Awareness, Bliss). Here, the mind no longer controls you, and you rest in the peace and freedom of your real nature.
