## AI Glossary (Alphabetical Order)
### B
**Backward Chaining (Goal-Driven Reasoning)** – Starts with a goal and works backward to determine which facts and rules support it.
### D
**Deep Learning** – Learning through layered neural networks that improve with experience and practice.
### F
**Forward Chaining (Data-Driven Reasoning)** – Starts with known facts and applies rules to derive new conclusions, moving from data to outcomes.
### K
**Knowledge Graph** – If facts and rules form relationships, the agent may be constructing a knowledge graph.
### M
**Machine Learning (ML) for Pattern Extraction** – If structured data is provided, ML algorithms may extract patterns from it.
### R
**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – Learning through trial and error, like learning to ride a bicycle by receiving rewards or penalties.

- Takes actions
- Receives rewards or penalties
- Adjusts future actions accordingly

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – If AI is recalling facts dynamically instead of relying on a static model, it is using RAG:

- Fetches relevant information from external sources dynamically
- Enhances responses with retrieved knowledge

**Rule-Based Learning (Symbolic AI)** – Uses predefined facts (knowledge) and rules (logic) to infer new knowledge.

### S
**Supervised Learning** – Learning from labeled data, like a student being taught with examples and corrections.
### U
**Unsupervised Learning** – Learning from unlabeled data, discovering patterns and relationships independently.
